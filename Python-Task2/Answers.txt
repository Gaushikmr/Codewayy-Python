1.Why is list used?

*List in Python are ordered and have a definite count. 
*The elements in a list are indexed according to a definite sequence and the indexing of a list is done with 0 being the first index. 
*Each element in the list has its definite place in the list, which allows duplicating of elements in the list, with each element having its own distinct place and credibility.

2.How do lists and sets differ?
 *Sets-Unordered collections of unique elements

  *Lists - ordered collections of elements

 *Sets -allows you to do operations such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference.
 i.e operations of math's set theory. Sets doesn't allow indexing and are implemented on hash tables.

 *Lists -are really variable-length arrays, not Lisp-style linked lists.
 In lists the elements are accessed by indices.
