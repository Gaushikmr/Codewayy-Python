# Codewayy-Python
This Repository contains  tasks related to python given by Codewayy. 

**Day-1**

* Installation  

* What is Python and why to learn it?

* Working with variables

**Day-2**

* List

* Tuple

* Sets

* Dictionaries

**Day-3** 

* A program in Python for calculating and printing details(full name, total marks, percentage, grade) of a student using functions.

* A program in Python to calculate the length of two strings by concatenating them.

* A program in Python to print all the numbers from 1 to 10 except 3 and 7 using for and while loops.

 **Day-4** 

*  A program in Python to print all the prime numbers in n*n matrix.

*  A program in Python which imports files as modules. The modules contain user defined list functions, string functions and logical operator functions.

**Day-5** 

* A program in Python which makes use of the Python error handling, your program should include: Try, Except, Raise, Finally keyword.

* A program in Python which makes use of the different match functions(min 3) and the sort function for list, tuples, sets etc.

* A program in Python to read a text file and print it’s content.

* A program in Python which should take a string of 3-4 lines and write it to a txt file.

**Task 6** :

* A function for checking the speed of drivers. This function should have one parameter: speed. If speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5km above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”

* A Python program to remove an empty tuple(s) from a list of tuples. 

* A Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

* Find all occurrences of “at” in given string ignoring the case(take string as input from user.)

* Create a function to count number of words in a sentence (Take input from user) A positive integer, n, is said to be perfect if the sum of its proper divisors equals the number itself. (Proper divisors include 1 but not the number itself.) If this sum is less than n, the number is deficient, and if the sum is greater than n, the number is abundant. Use the function name and the argument as: def findType (n): The Function should return 1 if the given integer is a deficient number, return 0 if it is a perfect number and return -1 if it is a abundant number.
